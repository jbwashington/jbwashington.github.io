## Full-Stack Developer & Privacy Advocate

I build modern web applications and browser-based utilities with a focus on performance, privacy, and developer experience. My work spans SaaS platforms, headless CMS implementations, and self-contained browser tools that respect user privacy.

### Technical Focus

**Application Architecture**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and React Server Components
- TypeScript strict mode across all projects
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Row Level Security)
- Headless CMS with Payload CMS
- Comprehensive testing (Vitest, Playwright, pgTAP)

**AI & Automation**
- LLM integration (Groq API, Claude Code)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server development
- Workflow automation (eBay photo organization, data processing)
- AI-powered insights and content generation

**Payment & Subscription Systems**
- Stripe integration and Sync Engine implementation
- Multi-tier subscription management
- Usage-based billing and promo codes
- Feature gating and access control

**Privacy-First Browser Utilities**
- Self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript tools
- No build tools, no tracking, no data collection
- Offline-capable with CDN-only dependencies
- Mobile-responsive and accessible

### Notable Projects

### Development Philosophy

**Modern Tooling**
- Bun for package management and build performance
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design systems
- shadcn/ui component library
- ESLint 9.0 + Prettier for code quality

**Quality & Testing**
- Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
- Database testing with pgTAP
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

**Privacy & Performance**
- Zero tracking or analytics on personal projects
