# Full-Stack Developer & Privacy Advocate

I build **privacy-first browser utilities** and **high-performance SaaS platforms** with modern web technologies.

## What I Build

### Privacy-First Browser Utilities
Self-contained tools that run entirely in your browser—no tracking, no data collection, no backend servers. Check out the [browser utilities](/tools.html) including contact scrapers, playlist editors, fingerprint analyzers, and markdown converters.

### SaaS Applications
Production-grade platforms with Next.js 15, Supabase, and comprehensive testing:
- **Connective Sports** - GPS performance analytics eliminating 20+ hours/week of manual data entry
- **NCRA** - National college recruitment platform with role-based access control
- **FullStackTechNYC** - Headless CMS platform with Payload CMS and MDX

### AI & Automation
MCP servers, workflow automation, and AI-powered insights using Groq API and Claude Code.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
**Backend:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Stripe Sync Engine
**AI/ML:** Groq API, Model Context Protocol, AI SDK
